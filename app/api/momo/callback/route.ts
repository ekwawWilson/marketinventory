/**
 * POST /api/momo/callback
 *
 * Receives the final outcome of a MoMo payment from Hubtel, and completes the
 * sale the till was waiting to record.
 *
 * The Receive Money API is asynchronous: the initial response is only ever
 * "0001 — pending", and the real result arrives here up to 30 seconds later.
 * Hubtel makes PrimaryCallbackUrl mandatory for that reason, and treats the
 * status endpoint as a fallback for when no callback arrives within five
 * minutes.
 *
 * This is what makes a payment survive the till. The cashier's browser polls
 * for the same outcome and will usually record the sale first, but if that tab
 * is closed, reloaded, or loses power while the customer is entering their PIN,
 * this endpoint is the only thing standing between an approved payment and a
 * customer who has been charged for a sale nobody recorded.
 *
 * Payload:
 *   { ResponseCode: "0000" | "2001", Message: "success" | "failed",
 *     Data: { ClientReference, TransactionId, ExternalTransactionId, Amount,
 *             Charges, AmountAfterCharges, AmountCharged, OrderId,
 *             PaymentDate, Description } }
